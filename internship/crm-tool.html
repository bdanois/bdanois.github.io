                  <div class='text-intern-1 text-section-1'><p>The purpose of our CRM Tool web application is to allow users to create, edit and delete lists. They can also populate the list with items, and have the ability to edit and delete these items.<br><br>The main feature that makes our web application interactive is the ability to drag and drop lists. By selecting the arrow icon at the top of the list, the user can drag and drop it to their desired location. The items in the list are also draggable.<br><br></p>

                  <p>The work was divided between me and my fellow intern. We first designed the layout using HTML and CSS. I designed the main layout of the grid using CSS Grid while she designed the navigation header.
                  <br><br>We then implemented the drag and drop feature through the use of a javascript library called Dragula. We developed JavaScript objects for the lists and items and then organized those into a dynamic array that changed as the location of each item changed.</p> <p>Overall I gain immense knowledge and experience working on this project. I had never developed a Web Application from scratch before this. Also I had worked with JavaScript libraries but not to the extent that this project required. Moving forward I am now more comfortable building web templates from scratch and manipulating JavaScript libraries. I also gained additional expertise with HTML and CSS and was introduced to CSS Grid.</p></div>
