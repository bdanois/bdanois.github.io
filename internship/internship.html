              <div class='ex-img-1'>
                <div class='ex-text-1'>Throughout the internship, I worked on various side tasks including fixing css bugs in web pages for clients that my boss developed. The main project we worked on throughout the internship was developing a CRM tool for the business to utilize. It's purpose took the place of their whiteboard where they typical dealt with client relations.

            <div class="ex-img-2"></div>
            <div class='ex-text-2'>The CRM tool is interactive as users can create and delete new lists to categorize their clients. Additionally they can add clients to each list and the client names are editable. I worked on this with one other intern. We began with the basic CSS and HTML. I worked on the layout of the lists, using CSS Grid as appose to Bootstrap.

            <div class='ex-img-3'></div>
              <div class='ex-text-3'>The key feature of the application was the ablility to not only edit and delete text, but the ability to drag and drop lists and clients from one list to another. My fellow intern and I developed the drag feature together using the JavaScript library Dragula.
